# MCSpace


Made by JTEpic

Minecraft Space Mod project started october 2025


## Introduction

MCSpace is an Open Source, multi-platform minecraft mod. It provides a few cool additions to Minecraft.

MCSpace natively supports Linux, macOS and Windows and other Unix-like systems. On Linux both Wayland and X11 are supported.

MCSpace is licensed under the (ENTER LICENSE) license.

You can download the latest development or stable release as source.

The documentation is available online and is included in all source archives. See the release notes for new features, caveats and deprecations in the latest release. For more details see the version history.

The master branch is the stable integration branch and should always compile and run on all supported platforms, although details of newly added features may change until they have been included in a release. New features and many bug fixes live in other branches until they are stable enough to merge.

(MCSpace exists because of the contributions of many people around the world, whether by reporting bugs, providing community support, adding features, reviewing or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting features or fixing bugs.)


## Compiling MCSpace

MCSpace is written primarily in Java. MCSpace itself requires only the Java compiler.

MCSpace supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2013 and later, MinGW and MinGW-w64, on macOS with Clang and on Linux and other Unix-like systems with GCC and Clang. It will likely compile in other environments as well, but this is not regularly tested.

See the compilation guide for more information about how to compile MCSpace yourself.


## Using MCSpace
